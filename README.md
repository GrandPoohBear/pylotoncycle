## General info
As someone who wants to see my progress over time, I've been wanting a way
to pull and play with my ride data. However, I'm also cautious about linking
myself to too many external parties. As I've been playing with other libraries
out there, I wanted something that was a bit more intuitive and would play
nicer with the rest of my python code. So, PylotonCycle is born.

## TODO
* Lots more to cover. I want to find the right format for pulling in the
ride performance data.
